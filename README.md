# jq - a sed for json

jq is a utility for extracting/editing/displaying structured information encoded as json
sed is a very versatile program for extracting/editing/displaying information encoded as text.
Both of them are quite powerful, but also dificult to use;

this text tries to provide illustrated example of jq processing pipelines. each link in the example will show you an intermedeate result of each processing step.
i hope that this will make it easier to understand what exactly is going on there.
