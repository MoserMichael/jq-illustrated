# jq - a sed for json

[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)  is a utility for extracting/editing/displaying structured information encoded as json
sed is a very versatile program for extracting/editing/displaying information encoded as text.
Both of them are quite powerful, but also dificult to use;

[this text](https://mosermichael.github.io/jq-illustrated/dir/content.html)  tries to provide illustrated example of jq processing pipelines. each link in the example will show you an intermedeate result of each processing step. 

[this text](https://mosermichael.github.io/jq-illustrated/dir-single-file/content.html) is the same tutorial, but with inline data (no links).

The html was created by [this script](https://github.com/MoserMichael/jq-illustrated/blob/master/scr.sh) 

This tutorial also made it to the Hacker News front page! [link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22626080) ; I really learned quite a bit from the comments section. Thanks for the feedback.
